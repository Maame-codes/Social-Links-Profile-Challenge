## Overview

This challenge was to test my html and css skills by building a social links page.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

First of all, I drew down the outline of the page, hence I started with the HTML of the page. When I was done, I then went ahead to add the styling; the font sizes, colors etc. Then I added the various div's to group them, to make individual styling easier for me. With the help of figma, I was able to get the correct padding and margins for the various divs in the code. Whenever I was lost, I used w3schools mainly for documentation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma

### What I learned

The most important thing I learnt in this particular project, was how some codes in css would affect your styling for different codes later. A personal example for me was, I initially styled my css to have all 'p' elements to have a white background;

```css
p {
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

But this code was affecting my hovering effects over the social media links section, after debugging and doing my research, I realised there could be a problem from that source. When I commented it out and tried the hovering effects again, it seemed to work (I do not have a clear reason why, but I will further research on that)

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me a lot with documentation and helped me to refresh my memory on the basic stuff I had forgotten.
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - This helped me with getting the correct sizes of div's and colors. Made it really easy for me to finish my projects, instead of guessing the sizes.
